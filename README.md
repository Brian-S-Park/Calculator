# Calculator Project
This is the final project from the Odin Project's Foundation course. This project was made with html, css, and javascript. I learned so many new skills from this course and I had a lot of fun making each project. Each struggle was a humbling experience that taught me how to go about finding the answers that I needed to complete the task at hand.
